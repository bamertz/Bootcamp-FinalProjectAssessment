## Project Overview

[Final Project](https://github.com/jwetapatel/VideoGameSalesAnalysis_based-on-Genre-vs-Region.git)


## Self-Assessment

I held a project manager-type role within our group. I created all of our group zoom meetings/sessions. I created the Overall/Final Presentation. I created the Dashboard presentation for Segment 2. I also met individually with most of the team members to help them with their sections. Specifically, I met with Raf and worked on connecting the MLM to the database by using SQLAlchemy. I helped organize the GitHub and I communicated with team members and checked off every section of the rubric to make sure we met all of the grading criteria.
