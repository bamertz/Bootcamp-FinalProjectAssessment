# FinalProjectAssessment

## Project Overview

Our group exlplored Video Game Sales across North America, Europe, and Japan. We started with 4 different data sets from Kaggle (a site full of datasets) and joined them together in our SQL Lite Database. We limited the data to three consoles: PS4, Xbox One, and Wii-U. We then limited the data into 15 different Genres. We then used Jupyter Notebook to do our Machine Learning Model, performing simple linear regressions on each region. Lastly we displayed our data in a tableau dashboard.

## Self-Assessment

I held a project manager-type role within our group. I created all of our group zoom meetings/sessions. I created the Overall/Final Presentation. I created the Dashboard presentation for Segment 2. I also met individually with most of the team members to help them with their sections. Specifically, I met with Raf and worked on connecting the MLM to the database by using SQLAlchemy. I met with Diana and Cassandra while working on the Dashboard. I helped Jweta organize the GitHub. The only person I didn't help with too much is Cassandra on the Machine Learning Model. I communicated with team members and checked off every section of the rubric to make sure we met all of the grading criteria.
